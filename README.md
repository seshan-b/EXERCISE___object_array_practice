# Object-array-practice

This is a self-assessment to help you understand how you're doing with the content and main take-aways from week 1 of the bootcamp. Each of the tasks you can try will have you displaying artist, releases and listener data in various ways inside the terminal.

## Files and their purpose

* `data/*.js`: the data you'll use in `index.js`
* `task.js`: where you'll write the functions that complete the tasks below
* `tasks.test.js`: where you'll write the tests for the functions in `tasks.js`
* `index.js`: where you'll call the functions written in `tasks.js` so you can see the output

## Notes

* Try to write the tests first if you can.
* The functions in `tasks.js` should receive the data as parameters and return the necessary data rather than access the data directly. This will make them easier to test.
* Don't forget to stage, commit and push your changes after each task.
